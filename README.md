GenExplainer – Genomic Variant Interpreter

GenExplainer is a web application built to help anyone working with genetic data easily interpret gene variants. Whether you’re a clinician, researcher, or even a student, this tool can assist in understanding genetic mutations by either pasting a gene variant or uploading a VCF (Variant Call Format) file.

Why This Project?

Genetic data can be difficult to interpret, especially when you don’t have access to detailed, real-time databases. GenExplainer aims to fill this gap by providing an easy-to-use interface for interpreting genetic variants. The tool leverages a mock ClinVar database to offer insights about various genetic mutations, what they might mean clinically, and what actions could be recommended.

What’s Next?

The goal is to take GenExplainer beyond just a mock database and integrate real-time genetic databases like ClinVar and Ensembl, making the tool more accurate and useful. In the future, it will offer full clinical-grade features, allowing healthcare professionals to rely on it for daily tasks.

Features

Easy Variant Input: You can either paste a genetic variant (like BRCA1 c.68_69delAG) directly or upload a .vcf or .txt file.

Variant Interpretation: The tool will show detailed information on each genetic variant, explaining associated conditions and recommendations. If the variant isn't in the database, it will offer a general AI-based explanation.

Real-Time Feedback: Just paste your variant or upload a file, and get immediate results in seconds.

User-Friendly Interface: Designed with Streamlit, the app is simple to use and doesn’t require any technical background to get started.

Batch Processing: You can upload .vcf files containing multiple variants, and the app will process them all at once.

How Does It Work?

1. Input Your Data

Text Input: Paste the genetic variant in the provided text box.

File Upload: Upload a .vcf or .txt file with one or more genetic variants.


2. Get Results

Known Variants: The app checks the variant against the mock ClinVar database and provides information about its associated condition, clinical significance, and recommended actions.

Unknown Variants: For variants that aren't found in the database, the app will give a general explanation based on AI, suggesting possible impacts.


3. View Results

Each variant is displayed with:

Condition: The disease or syndrome associated with the variant.

Clinical Significance: Is it pathogenic, likely pathogenic, benign, or uncertain?

Recommendations: What should be done next based on the interpretation.

Installation

Here’s how to get the app up and running on your local machine:

1. Clone the Repo:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/genexplain.git
cd genexplain


2. Install Dependencies:

pip install streamlit pyngrok pandas


3. Authenticate ngrok (replace with your ngrok token):

import os
os.system("ngrok config add-authtoken YOUR_NGROK_TOKEN")


4. Run the App:

streamlit run genexplain_app.py

This will start the app locally. To make it accessible online, use ngrok:

from pyngrok import ngrok
public_url = ngrok.connect(8501)
print(f"Your GenExplain app is live at: {public_url}")

Project Structure

genexplain_app.py: The main application code.

clinvar_db: A mock database of genetic variants with associated conditions and recommendations.

ngrok: Used to expose the app to the internet, allowing public access.

Limitations

Right now, GenExplain is a basic tool with several limitations:

Mock Database: It only uses a small, mock version of ClinVar, so it’s not as comprehensive as real databases.

Basic Explanations: For unknown variants, the AI provides generic interpretations, which aren't as detailed as those from real expert systems.

Not for Clinical Use: While it’s useful for research and educational purposes, it’s not designed for clinical decision-making yet.

What’s Next?

Here’s what I want to add in the future:

Real Database Integration: Integrate with ClinVar, Ensembl, or other major databases to give real-time, accurate variant interpretations.

AI Explainability: I plan to use advanced AI techniques like LIME or SHAP to explain how the AI interprets the variants.

User Accounts: Allow users to save past variant interpretations, making it easier to track data over time.

PDF Reports: I want to add the ability for users to download reports that summarize their genetic variant data.
